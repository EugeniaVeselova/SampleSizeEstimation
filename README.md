# SampleSizeEstimation

Sample Size Estimation and Model Selection Technique

Sample size estimation methods are in `code/lib/m_models.py`. Each method takes a dataset with labels `X, y` and returns a dictionary with results of the estimation. Estimated optimal sample size is `m*`. Demonstration of usage of one of the methods can be seen in `Demo.ipynb`.
